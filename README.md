# functioningWebsite
I will be creating a fully functioning website that will consist of html css and javascript. This will be done through using bootstrap

To do list:
1 -> create a html and css navigation panal
2 -> add and edit the information and pictures layout so that they sync together
3 -> add hyperlinks to the other tabs within the homepage
4 -> do the same process as before on each of these
5 -> make sure that all these different web pages sybc with one another
6-> start looking at how javascript can be used to modify the web pages.
